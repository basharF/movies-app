This repository is part of a small student project involving a web application that works as a simplified movie recommendation system. The application interacts with the MovieLens 1M Dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) to efficiently query the top-rated movies and display a list of recommended movies for the logged-in user based on their taste similarity with other users.
